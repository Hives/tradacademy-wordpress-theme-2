TO DO
=====

- get lots of errors when creating a new course because it's trying to read course dates that aren't there
- final date calculator in the admin is not workingj
- where do we use dates?
	1. on course page
	2. in sidebar widget
	3. in menu when working out what courses to display
- testing:
	- dates save properly, including deleting date that are already saved
	- all different ways of displaying the date work correctly
	- multiple date blocks
- make "all day" end time make more sense? should it be like 23:59 or something?
- validation? how important is this now that fields are "readonly"???
- what if people leave one of the fields empty?
- need to escape user input. how important is this now that fields are "readonly"???
- copying old date data into new table - sure this works ok?
- warning that you might lose data when deleting a block?
- delete the old date table and code?
- when editing course, robot-only dates show when page is in mobile layout


DONE
====

- clear out data when duplicating date block
- screws up am/pm somehow when saving
- deleting and re-saving dates every time the course is saved causes the id to increment every time. possibly this is bad.
